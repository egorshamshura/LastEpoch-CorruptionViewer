# CorruptionViewer 

The mod allows you to view the current corruption without logging into it. It logs the values to a file every time you log into echoweb.

To start using the mod, download .dll file and melonloader. 

1) Download [MelonLoader.Installer.exe] & Install MelonLoader. Im using v6.1 since v6.2 has a small bug that sometimes doesn't start your game.
   (See [melonwiki])
- Run [MelonLoader.Installer.exe].
    - Click the SELECT button.
    - Select and Open the Game's EXE in your Game's Installation Folder.
    - Select which Version of MelonLoader to install using the Drop-Down List. (Or leave it as-is for the Latest Version.)
    - Click the INSTALL or RE-INSTALL button.
2) Put into Last Epoch folder

The current values of corruption can be found on the map when you select an island. The name of the monolith will look like: MonolithName (Corruption)
